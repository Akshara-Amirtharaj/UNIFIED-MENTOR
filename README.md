### 1. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Analytics (2000-2017)**

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) trends in India from 2000 to 2017. The aim was to understand sector-specific and year-wise investment patterns to provide insights into how FDI has influenced India's economic landscape over the years. Utilizing a robust dataset, the project employs various data visualization techniques and econometric models to highlight key sectors driving economic growth, the impact of regulatory and economic changes, and the effect of significant global events on FDI inflows. The analysis also provides policy recommendations and suggests future research directions to enhance India's competitiveness in attracting foreign investments.

### 2. **Bird Strikes Data Visualization and Analysis (2000-2011)**

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of bird strike incidents reported by the FAA between 2000 and 2011. Bird strikes are a significant risk to aviation safety, and this project aims to uncover critical insights into the frequency, timing, and impact of these events. The analysis includes year-wise trends, identification of high-risk airports, and the phases of flight most affected by bird strikes. Additionally, a Random Forest Classifier model was developed to predict the likelihood of bird strikes based on various features like aircraft type and weather conditions. The project concludes with proposed solutions to mitigate bird strike risks, including the implementation of advanced detection systems and habitat management strategies around airports.
